# MNIST-image-extractor-with-embedded-lable
This piece of code is an addition to the work done by ceykmc. This code is supposed to extract png images from the mnist compressed dataset and embed their labels into  the file name to make it relevant to anyone who wants to use it in a different way as they please.
